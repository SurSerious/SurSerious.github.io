  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791) stands among the greatest composers in history due to his unparalleled melodic genius, mastery of form, and prolific output. A child prodigy who wrote his first symphony at age 8, Mozart perfected the Classical style with works like *The Marriage of Figaro* and *Symphony No. 40*, blending structural clarity with emotional depth. His operas revolutionized the art form, while his piano concertos and chamber music set enduring standards. Though he died tragically young at 35, his 600+ compositions—ranging from playful to profound—capture the essence of human expression, earning him a legacy as "music itself" (Rubinstein). Mozart’s ability to make complexity sound effortless solidifies his immortality.

  Erik Satie (1866–1925) revolutionized classical music through his radical minimalism and avant-garde spirit. 
  A visionary who bridged Romanticism and Modernism, his <i>Gymnopédies</i> redefined piano composition with 
  hypnotic simplicity, while works like <i>Parade</i> (with Picasso) shattered traditional performance norms. 
  Satie pioneered "furniture music" (early ambient music), composed pieces with absurdist titles like 
  <i>Three Pieces in the Shape of a Pear</i>, and influenced everyone from Debussy to John Cage. His ability 
  to distill profound emotion into sparse, crystalline melodies—heard in timeless works like 
  <i>Gnossienne No. 1</i>—cements his legacy as music’s great iconoclast.
