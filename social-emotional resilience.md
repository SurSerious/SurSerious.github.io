***Strong social-emotional resilience, being better than low-value behaviors.***

### **TL;DR Advice for Building Social-Emotional Resilience**  

1. **Clarify Your Values**: Know who you are and what you stand for. Regularly remind yourself of your principles.  
2. **Practice Self-Awareness**: Notice when you're tempted to people-please or mimic others. Pause and ask, *"Is this aligned with my goals?"*  
3. **Set Boundaries**: Politely limit time and energy spent on people whose behavior you don’t want to emulate.  
4. **Stay Mindful**: Focus on being present and intentional in your interactions, rather than reacting automatically.  
5. **Seek Positive Influences**: Surround yourself with people who inspire and challenge you to grow.  
6. **Strengthen Inner Confidence**: Validate yourself instead of seeking external approval. Affirm your worth daily.  
7. **Detach From Negativity**: Don’t absorb others’ bad habits. Observe them without judgment, but stay grounded in your own identity.  
8. **Develop Self-Discipline**: Consistently act in alignment with your values, even when it's uncomfortable.  

**Mantra**: *"I am my own person. I choose behaviors that reflect my goals, not my surroundings."*
