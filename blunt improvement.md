# Social Improvement 101: Blunt Edition.

Hey sweetie, stop half assing this shit, man the fuck up and actualise social skills improvement. This is Social Improvement 101: Blunt Edition.

This isn’t about being liked. Just raw, unfiltered dominance in how you speak, listen, and command attention.

You don’t earn respect. You take it.

#### *Be proudly authentic and act in a way that is consistent with who you want to become.*

Authenticity isn’t some feel-good self-help mantra—it’s a goddamn elimination round. Most people are out here performing like circus animals for scraps of validation. Don’t be most people.

If it’s not funny, your face stays stone. Let the awkwardness rot in the air like bad perfume. Watch them squirm. That’s how you spot the real ones—they’ll respect you for it, not despite it.

Forced coolness? Pathetic. You think people can’t smell that tryhard desperation? It reeks like last night’s regret. Every time you contort yourself to fit in, you repel the only connections worth a damn—the ones that don’t require you to amputate your soul.

Here’s the brutal truth: The person you aspire to be? Start acting like them now. Not tomorrow, not when it’s convenient—today. Every compromised moment is a debt against your future self. Pay up or stay hollow.

Sincerity isn’t ‘nice’—it’s a filter. Let it burn away the dead weight. The right people won’t just find you—they’ll recognize you like a fucking war cry in the dark.
