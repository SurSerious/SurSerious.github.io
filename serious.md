## Act seriously

- Act seriously and you will attract people who are smart as opposed to jokers
	- Don't use moronic humor. (Things that make you appear silly or cringe)
	- If you are "joking" and seeming serious, you will come across as serious, especially in a serious environment, or if they don't know you well.


- Be literal with your words, speak with intelligences and confidence
	- Take long pauses and think about what you're going to say, don't rush your thoughts
	- Don't be weaselly and avoid saying what you should or want to say, especially if it seems scary
	- Speak slowly and clearly. Just because you understand something doesn't mean the other person does
	- Don't cut people off and truly listen
	- Don't laugh unless you find something funny
	- if it's on your mind, then say so clearly
	- Be brutally honest with yourself and others

- Be assertive (add hyperlink for dealing with poor behavior main doc once its made)
	- confront poor behavior by intense eye contact 
	- Walk away when you don't want to talk anymore.
	- Just like how it feels like I'm being mean when settling boundaries, it isn't. It isn't mean to act alpha or like a douch, it's a form of self love because of how much of a people pleaser I was.

-  Face facts
	- By acting serious we must confront and face up to the truth and uncomfortable situations. Such as 
		1. Be willing to push aside the ego and admit when something was our fault
		2. Face the truth and be honest especially when it's [[face scary thoughts | scary or uncomfortable]] to do so
		3. If something is on your mind say it straight away (this also mitigates [[Stress and worry|stress]])
- Actively listen 
	- interpret information by default as serious, don't ever think someone is joking unless they say they are
