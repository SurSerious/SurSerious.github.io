## Act seriously

- Act seriously, be firm with that, and you will attract people who are smart as opposed to jokers
	- No more being a people pleaser trying to make others laugh so they like you.

- Be brutally honest with yourself and others

- **say what you seriously mean**, dont be afraid to be vulnerable.
	- Explain what you are saying slowly and clearly. Just because you understand something doesn't mean the other person does
	- if it's on your mind, then say so clearly

- Don't make silly jokes like "you're pretty strong for ripping that paper towel" while laughing.
	- Saying things like seems unironically stupid I'm serious situations or if someone doesn't realize that you're joking

- *Act Alpha, become Alpha*
	- Remember to be assertive, and walk away when you don't want to talk anymore.
	- Just like how it feels like I'm being mean when settling boundaries, it isn't. It isn't mean to act alpha or like a douch, it's a form of self love because of how much of a people pleaser I was.

-  Face facts
	- By acting serious we must confront and face up to the truth and uncomfortable situations. Such as 
		1. Be willing to push aside the ego and admit when something was our fault
		2. Face the truth and be honest especially when it's scary or uncomfortable to do so
		3. If something is on your mind say it straight away (this also mitigates stress)
