## Act seriously


- Act seriously and you will attract people who are smart as opposed to jokers
	- Don't use moronic humor. (Things that make you appear silly or cringe)
	- If you are "joking" and seeming serious, you will come across as serious, especially in a serious environment, or if they don't know you well.
	- Be authentic


- Be literal with your words, speak with intelligence and confidence
	- Take pauses and think about how to respond
	- Be concise and straightforward to prevent misunderstanding

- Actively Listen
	- Don't cut people off. Respond after they have finished speaking
	- Truly listen and respond to what has been said
	- Don't make too many "acknowledgement sounds" when listening 
	- Don't laugh unless you find something funny


- Be Assertive
	- confront poor behavior with intense eye contact
	- take lead of the conversation
	- Walk away when you don't want to talk anymore.
	- Just like how it feels like I'm being mean when settling boundaries, it isn't. It isn't mean to act alpha or like a douch, it's a form of self love and confidence
